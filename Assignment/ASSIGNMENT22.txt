Q1) Interface is a java feature where it will only allow abstract methods. All the variables inside it are public static final and methods are public and abstract.

Q2) Only Public modifier can be used in an interface. 
	
	for eg:
		interface x
			{
				void show();
		
			   }
		class Y implements x
		{
			void show() // This method is by default public in an interface.
				{
					System.out.println("Showing everything here!!!!"); 
				}
		}

		class Main
		{
			public static void main(String []args)
			{
				Y obj = new Y();
				obj.show();
			}
		}

Q3) Interface is kind of a concept which helps in making a class.for eg : A car is a concept while the cars like waganor , innova, amaze all are real implementation of that car. So we can make car as an interface while we can make rest of them as classes.

Q4) In interface , we can only have abstract methods while in java we can have both.

    In interface, a constructor is not present as an object cannot be made for it but abstract classes has default 
    constructors in them.

    Interface uses implemnts keyword while abstract claseses use extends keyword.

    Variables in interface are public static final by default but that is not the case in abstract classes.
