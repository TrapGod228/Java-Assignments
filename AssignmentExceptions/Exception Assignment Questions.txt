							Exception Assignment Questions

Q1) There are three types of errors in java:
	1) Syntax error - They are the errors which happens when you have written the syntax or used the rules of the 			  program wrongly. Compiler will throw an error.

	2) Logical error - In this type of errors, compiler will not throw an error as it is syntactically correct 			   but logically the output coming is wrong.

	3) Runtime error - Here the eror happens at the runtime and have to be handled or else your program wil shut 			   down.

Q2) An unwanted or unexpected event that disturbs the normal flow of execution of a program is called an exception in java.

Q3) You can handle an exception in java using try and catch block.
	for eg:
		int res = 0;
		int num1 = 2;
		int num2 = 0;
		try
		{
			res = num1/num2;
		} 
		catch(ArithmeticException e)
		{
			System.out.println("Error.....");
		}  

Q4) We need exception handling in order to handle exceptions in java. If not handled the program might shut down and the flow of execution of the program will be disrupted.

Q5) Exceptions are those whcih can be recoverd while error in java cannot be recoverd or handled due to lack of system resources.

Q6) Different types of exceptions in java are:
	1. Runtime Exceptions
	2. IO Exceptions
	3. SQL Exceptions
	4. AWT Exceptions
	5. Interrupted Exceptions 

Some of the Runtime exceptions are :
	Arithmetic Exceptions
	NullPointer Exceptions
	ArrayIndexOutoOBoundException 

Q7) We can use try with resource but normally we cant use try on its own, as we need to handle the exception when it is encountered . When we use try alone there is no logic behind it.
