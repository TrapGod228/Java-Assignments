						ASSIGNMENT MULTITHREADING

Q1) Excecuting several tasks simultaneously where each task is a seperate independent part of the same program. Here                each independent part is called a thread. 
It is important because it helps in having a different line of execution for each part and thus reducing the waiting time for the processor.

Q2) The main advantages of multithreading are it reduces the response time of the system and it also improves its performance.

Q3) A seperate flow of execution is called a thread. If there is only one flow then it is called sinle threadf programming.

Q4) The two ways for implementing thread in java are:
	1. implementing Runnable interface.
	2. extending Thread class.

Q5) A thread is a seperate flow of execution or we can say it is a part of the same process. While process is the whole program in itself when it is in RAM. 

Q6) In order to make a thread daemon we have to set the daemon flag to true before starting the thread.

Q7) We can make the main thread wait for the child thread as well as we can make the child thread also wait for the main thread.

 If a thread doesnt want to perform any operation for a particular amount of time then we use the sleep().
