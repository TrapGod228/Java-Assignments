						Generics and map Assignment

Q1) Maps are used to represent a group of individual objects as a key value pair.

Q2) The commonly used implementation for maps are:
	1. Object put
	2. void putAll
	3. Object get
	4. Object remove
	5. boolean containsKey
	6. boolean containsValue
	7. boolean isEmpty
	8. int size
	9. void clear()

Q3) Hashmap - 	underlying data structure is hashtable.
		null insertion is allowed for keys only once but for values it 		can be any number of time.
		
    TreeMap - 	undelying data structure is redblacktree.
		null entry will result in NullPointerException.

Q4) There is a method called containsKey which returns a boolean value . It tells whether a particular key is in the map or not.

Q5) Generics are used so that a particular type of data is stored instead of hetrogenous data.

Q6) Generics are used to provide type safety and also to resolve typecasting problem.

Q7) In Generics we are associating a type parameter to the class , such type of parameterised classes are nothing but generic classes.

Q8) Type Parameter are used on classes. These are done so that the concept of generics can be used. Here, based on our runtime requirement , T will be replaced with our provided type.

Q9) Generic method takes data as parameters whose type is determined during the runtime.Here the concept of type parameter comes in.

Q10) Using ArrayList, an object can be made which can contain hetrogenous type of data but with the help of  ArrayList<T> we can make an object which can contain homogenous type of data only.
